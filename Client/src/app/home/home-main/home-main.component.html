<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>This is a collection of different projects involving AI that I'm creating in free time to learn about the topic.</p>
<p>This website is made with Angular (SCSS and Angular Material for styling)</p>
<p>The AI is made with Python and numpy. I've decided not to use frameworks like Tensorflow, but to implement it from
    scratch in order to learn the math behind Deep Learning.</p>
<p>The training happens entirely on your browser, using Pyodide to run Python scripts. Anyone can contribute to
    improving the AI models using the 'Train' page.</p>
<p>In the future, I intend to add other projects involving audio, text, and games like Chess.</p>
<p>Use the sidebar to explore the projects. Enjoy!</p>
