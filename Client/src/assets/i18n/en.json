I've decided not to use frameworks like Tensorflow, but to implement it from scratch in order to learn the math behind Deep Learning.\nThe training happens entirely on your browser, using Pyodide to run Python scripts. Anyone can contribute to improving the AI models using the 'Train' page.\nIn the future, I intend to add other projects involving audio, text, and games like Chess.\nUse the sidebar to explore the projects. Enjoy!"
