        "Description": "This is a AI to recognize digits written by users. It was trained using the MNIST database with cross entropy as loss function. It uses a combination of Convolution, MaxPool, Dense, Dropout, and ReLu layers.\nThis website is made with Angular (SCSS and Angular Material for styling).\nThe AI is made with Python and numpy. I've decided not to use frameworks like Tensorflow, but to implement it from scratch in order to learn the math behind Deep Learning.\nThe training happens entirely on your browser, using Pyodide to run Python scripts. Anyone can contribute to improving the AI model using the 'Train' page. Enjoy!"
